Nate and Jevon discussed the potential for building a large database of music information from various sources, including Billboard, Genius, and Spotify, and the use of a data warehouse and dashboard to store and visualize the data. They explored the potential for hooking up hundreds of data sources to the warehouse and dashboard, and the insights that could be gained from analyzing the data. They also discussed the potential uses of Pine Cone, a vector database for AI, in analyzing data and providing additional information to open AI models.

Additionally, they discussed the importance of design and data presentation for their music platform, and how they plan to differentiate themselves from competitors like Spotify. They aim to create the best possible customer experience and upload content by October.
