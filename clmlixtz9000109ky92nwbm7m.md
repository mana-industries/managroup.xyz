Jevon and Nate collaborated on designing and editing the website logo and layout, experimenting with different styles and colours. They also discussed the final design of the MANA TV landing page, deciding to change the categories listed and work on the content. They planned the different sections of their website, starting with About Us, followed by Music, Live Stream, and Submission.

They also discussed the future of music experience with the introduction of MANA, a networking association that combines music and AI technology. They talked about the app's features and the need for five images to be added to the website. Overall, they were excited about the potential of MANA to revolutionize the music industry.
